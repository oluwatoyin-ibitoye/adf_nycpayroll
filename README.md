# Project Overview

The NYC Payroll Data Warehouse project delivers a robust solution for processing, analyzing, and storing payroll data for New York City. Leveraging Azure Data Factory, the project orchestrates Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) workflows to convert raw data from various sources into a well-structured data warehouse hosted on Azure SQL Database. This system facilitates advanced analytics and reporting, empowering data-driven decision-making in employee compensation, agency performance, and workforce management.
This project is designed to support NYC's goals in two key areas:
Financial Resource Allocation Analysis: Provide insights into how the City allocates its financial resources, focusing on determining what portion of the budget is allocated to overtime expenses.
Transparency and Public Accessibility: Make payroll data publicly accessible to promote transparency and demonstrate how municipal employees spend the City's budget on salaries and overtime pay.
By addressing these objectives, the NYC Payroll Data Warehouse contributes to more effective financial oversight and fosters public trust through data-driven transparency.
